### The problems that might happen in monte carlo simulation:

* The states are in the continuous domain, so the same states may never occur
    more than twice in our map. This can be prcessed by some states aggregator
    than treat the states near each other as the same states.

* Even though the range aggregation may alleviate above problem,
